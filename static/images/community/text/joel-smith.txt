Joel W Smith
Director of Photography/Filmmaker

I joined WELD mainly out of necessity to separate work and home. Having 2 small boys makes it difficult to do any work from home. However, what I didnâ€™t realize when joining WELD was how much like home it would become. The friendships and collaborations that have already flourished in the last year have been worth their weight in gold.
