WELD // Non-Profit Marketing & Development Consultant
“Throughout my life, I’ve learned there’s something empowering about taking notice of the movement around us. Good or bad, success or failure — there is beauty in the trust and vulnerability of each individual’s story. Being in a community with people who are consciously looking for and calling out the beauty around them is the power of WELD.”
