Fashion//Travel//Humanitarian Photographer 
I think that collaboration is shaking up the work place and I have never felt more pumped to be apart of what is going on here at WELD.  I have grown and connected as a photographer from this community and I don’t think it’s stopping anytime soon.  ( you can change any of this up..)
